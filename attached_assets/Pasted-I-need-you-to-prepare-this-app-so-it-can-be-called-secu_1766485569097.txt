I need you to prepare this app so it can be called securely by a Custom GPT Action.

Your task is to expose and clearly document the connection details I need.

REQUIREMENTS

1) PUBLIC BASE URL
- Ensure the app is reachable via a public HTTPS URL when running.
- Identify and clearly state the base URL that external services should use to call the API.
- This base URL must work for POST requests from outside Replit.

2) API AUTHENTICATION
- Implement a simple API key authentication mechanism suitable for private use.
- The API key must be required for all requests to POST /api/recipes.
- The API key must be read from an environment variable so it is not hardcoded.

- Choose ONE of the following header formats (your choice):
  a) Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
  b) X-API-Key: <API_KEY>

3) API RESPONSE BEHAVIOUR
- If the API key is missing or invalid, return a clear 401 or 403 response.
- If the request payload is invalid, return a clear validation error.
- If successful, return the created recipe record and its ID.

4) OPENAPI SCHEMA
- Produce an OpenAPI (v3) schema that fully documents:
  - POST /api/recipes
  - Required headers (including the API key)
  - Request body structure
  - Response structure
- Ensure the schema includes a `servers` section pointing to the public base URL.

5) DOCUMENTATION OUTPUT
- Update the README with a section titled “Custom GPT Integration”.
- In that section, explicitly list:
  - The public base URL
  - The full endpoint path for recipe creation
  - Which header is used for authentication
  - The exact environment variable name used for the API key
  - A short example request (headers + JSON body)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT add extra endpoints beyond what is needed.
- Do NOT add OAuth, user accounts, or complex auth flows.
- Do NOT expose the API key in code or logs.
- Focus on clarity and correctness rather than cleverness.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK
I should be able to copy:
- the base URL
- the endpoint path
- the header name
- the OpenAPI schema

…and paste them directly into a Custom GPT Action configuration without guessing anything.
